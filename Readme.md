# Blue Sky
## iOS Weather Application

### Blue Sky is a weather application built using best practices with Swift 5, UIKit and XCode 12.  In order to demonstrate scalable, reusable code that is easily reviewed by peers. 

## What's Inside?

- Vectorized assets
- No storyboards! 
- Stack Views
- Protocol-Delegate Pattern
- JSON Parsing with `Codable`
- Swift Unit Testing _TDD!!_
- Styling text with NSAttributedString _easy and efficent!_ 
- Automatic retrieval of user location via `CoreLocation`
- Allow users to manually search for a weather report using `UITextFieldDelegate`

## Benefits of the techniques used here

- Auto layout uses mathematical equations to place UI elements on screen, in the background it is 
simple linear algebra that brings views to life. This is how the application can be rendered on 
multipe screen sizes with programatically defined layouts. The anchoring system 
(top/leading/trailing/bottom) in autolayout is key here. 
- The protocol-delegate pattern is common with `UIKit` because it sovles a probelm with communication.  Classes use protocols
to broadcast events.  Delegates receive communications from the protocol. In doing so, this reduces coupling between classes. It 
does a really good job of separating responsibility between generating an event and reacting to it. 
- Since storyboards show up as an .xml file during the code review process, programatic layouts are much 
easier to collaborate on. 
- Stack views are Apple's way of streamlining a layout for a collection of views (for a column or row). 
This allows us to define fewer constraints, and get the same results. UIStackView works perfectly for 
certain elements of BlueSky. Not to mention, this leads to fewer lines of code and therefore a more
efficient development workflow.
- Although minimally used here, because the scope of this app is limited, `NSAttributedString` is a welcome
addition to BlueSky.  The city, state and temperature labels on screen are a key part of the UI. This technique
allows us to apply different styles to each part of the string (for example 10ÂºC). 


## The Protocol-Delegate relationship in this app

- We define a `WeatherService` with a function called `fetchWeather()` which communicates via a delegate.
In order to accomplish this, we define a protocol called `didFetchWeateher` (implemented in `WeatherViewController`)
Second, we have to register a callback (delegate) for the protocol. This way, when `fetchWeather()` is called, 
it has an instance (reference) via the delegate.  It can pass the weather object, and therefore update the UI.

## A note on (the wonderful) Codable
### Decoding
- Codable is the bridge between JSON and swift.  Say we have JSON coming in from an API representing Weather data. We can convert this JSON into a `struct` by 
defining a `struct` that matches the incoming JSON.  Then, all we need to do is use the `JSONDecoder` to decode the json, which matches the `Weather` type. The 
JSON is **decoded** into a swift construct that we can access within our codebase. This is typically used to GET data fro man API. 

### Encoding
- We can go from Swift to JSON by using the `JSONEncoder`. This process is essentially decoding in reverse, as we can go from a struct to JSON. This is used to send data TO an API using POST or PUT for example. 

### Coding Keys
- For a developer like myself, who only uses camelCase in Swift files, sometimes JSON data with `snake_case` presents a threat to my coding style.  `CodingKeys` bridge how we would like to represent data in Swift, with how it is coming in from JSON. `CodingKeys` are nothing more than a creative use for `enum`.
